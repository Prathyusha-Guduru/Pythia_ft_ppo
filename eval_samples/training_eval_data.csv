TITLE: Me [19 F] with my friend [19 M], not sure if I may have messed things up already.

POST: Hello hello everybody. I hope this isn't too trivial of a question to ask on here, but I've been feeling a bit out of my depth when it comes to this situation (I've had only one relationship before, and for many reasons, it was out of the ordinary).

Okay! So, a couple of weeks ago, I started talking to this guy on Facebook, through a student group that we were both part of. I thought he was sort of cute, so I sent him a PM just to talk, etc, etc. We're both transfer students at the same school, so I knew that we could eventually meet in person once we both moved on-campus. So, we did, and we hung out maybe twice, just as friends.

Okay. So, everything is going pretty well. We talk over Facebook and Snapchat, whatever. So, Saturday night, I was just hanging out with people and kind of being bored, when I got a Snapchat from him asking what I was doing. I asked if he wanted to hang out, so we did. 

We ended up smoking pot (the first time for me, ever), and sort of just wandering around. Eventually we ended up back at his dorm room, where high me decided to just go for it, and I came on to him pretty strongly. It worked out for me (luckily, otherwise things would have been really super awkward), and we ended up messing around but not having sex.

Yesterday, however, I ended up going to hang out with him again, and this time we did sleep together. Afterward, we kind of discussed what we were going to do, and he just said that he wanted to ""play it by ear"" and not slap any labels on anything. I'm wondering if this means that he wants a fwb-type situation, or if he might actually be interested in me. The way I've been acting is extremely out of character for me, and I am not interested in having a fuck buddy. I like him, and I would be very interested in maybe seeing where things go, but I'm worried that I may have ruined my chances of a relationship by sleeping with him already.

TL;DR:","My ""friend"" and I were just hanging out, and it turned into an ""ass/panties"" fuck buddy. Whoops. Now I\'m not interested."

TITLE: My 11 year old sons friend died suddenly, his funeral is today and my son suddenly doesn't want to attend.

POST: **repost from relationships**

A couple of weeks ago my sons friend died in a freak accident, it was completely shocking and horrific. He isn't aware of the details, but we broke the news to him as soon as we found out and have spoke about it many times with him.

He has cried about it, asked questions and spoken about it with his older siblings (who have also recently lost a friend) and seemed to be okay with it (considering the circumstances).

Leading up to the funeral, we have talked about it and explained what he is to expect, etc. This is his first funeral, so we have made sure that he is aware of everything.

But today is the day, and he has broken down in the morning and says he doesn't want to go. I have no idea what to do. Do I push him to go? I am worried that he will regret it later, as he is a kid who doesn't like to do new things. But at the same time, I don't want to pressure him to do something he doesn't want to do.
Advice, please?

TITLE: The girl [26 F] I [22 M] have been seeing for a month didn't respond to me at all yesterday while hanging out with a friend [~30? M].

POST: She gets terrible service while at her house, but I texted her 3 times yesterday, 4-5 hours apart. She didn't call me until early this morning and left a voicemail that she was busy all day with a friend who showed up out of the blue.

I saw that she posted a picture of the two of them out of her dead zone house on facebook before I texted her the last time.

I don't mind that she hangs out with friends, and I know it's pretty early in the relationship, but am I wrong to be a little annoyed that she didn't respond until 24 hours after my first text?

TL;DR:","Girl doesn't respond to me at all when I text her today, while we hang out with a friend.  Should I bother trying again?"

TITLE: TIFU by accidently kicking an old woman

POST: So this didn't happen today but actually about a year or two ago.

I was at my granddads funeral so of course it was all very sad and full of lots of crying old people. After the ceremony everyone walks outside the building and onto the other side of the small road the hearses drive down. Now the road is important because obviously if there's a road, there's a curb onto the sidewalk, so most of us are on the other side of the road, besides a few older people walking a lot slower. 

As one of the old woman goes to walk up the curb she trips (obviously didn't notice there was one due to crying and whatnot) and I'm the only one who not only sees it coming but is in any position to do anything. So of course as someone who is an avid football (soccer if you're American) player my first instinct is to stick my foot out and kind of control her head like you would with a football.

Of course you can imagine this looked horrendously bad on my part (quite literally kicking an old woman while she's down) and as she got up everyone noticed that her nose was completely grey/black as if she'd just been punched in the face. She assures us she's fine and we go to the dinner afterwards where someone finally informs her of her bruising. She goes to the toilet and comes out with a completely normal looking nose so of course everyone's wondering how and it turns out that the ""bruising"" was actually shoe polish from my shoe, confirming to everyone that i kicked this poor old lady square in the face as she fell.

TL;DR:","had an inadvertensly kicking a woman in the face as you're being walked past, she gets up and you're probably going to get a kick. I'm sorry."

TITLE: I [32 M] found out my wife [31 F] had an affair a year and a half ago, now I can't stop thinking about other women.

POST: Wife and I moved accross the country with our two daughters <our dream.  

We settle in, happy, rosey veiws, living the dream or so I though.  6mo later she sleeps with a co-worker. I find out about it four months later on my birthday. Shit hits the fan at home and work - she and d-bag are fired. Did I mention she work for a Christian organization?

Fast forward 18 months - today. I don't have a marrage - rather - a roomate who's the mother of my children.  She's too fragile to say I want out, but I want out.

Do I pursue an ""affair"" or just flip the world upside down my kids and leave?

TL;DR:",I love my wife. I wanted to have an affair and now I can't stop thinking about her.  Do I pursue an affair or try to be the man and be a normal husband/father (even though I'm not married)?

TITLE: Caffeine addiction. Anyone taking vitamins or supplements with caffeine?

POST: I have a horrible caffeine addiction, and I don't like sacrificing any of my daily calories for coffee. I used to drink 5-6 Diet Dr. Peppers a day, but I have switched to almost exclusively drinking only water most days. I do have a Diet Dr. Pepper occasionally, and I know that technically it's okay to probably have one a day, but I honestly just feel better all around when I drink only water. But if I don't have some caffeine in the morning, I will be writhing in the floor in pain with a skull-pounding headache by mid-day. I know. Ridiculous, right? 

So, I went to the vitamin aisle the other day in search of a supplement with a little caffeine and the only thing I found was One A Day Adult Vitacraves Gummies with Energy Support. Here's the website with [nutritional info] One serving is 20 calories and has 90 mg of caffeine. There's also some vitamin B6, B12, and folic acid in there that supposedly helps turn food into energy. I have no idea if that's true. I've been taking them a couple days, and so far I do feel more energized and I haven't had any headaches. The issue is that one bottle is around $9 and there are only 60 in a bottle. You have to take 4 (4!) a day, which is very intriguing considering the brand name and all. So it'll cost me around $20 a month. Which is admittedly cheaper than what I used to spend on Diet Dr. Peppers, but still. I was just curious if anyone else had a better option for caffeine in a supplement or vitamin?

TL;DR:",I have a caffeine habit but I'm looking for a more viable option with caffeine in combination with some other nutrients. Thoughts?

TITLE: TIFU by eating a banana.

POST: So, this actually happened yesterday. I am currently studying abroad in a tropical country. As a result, the selection of locally grown fruit is phenomenal. Now, I'm not usually one for bananas, but I keeping hearing they are much more flavorful here, so I decided I'd give it a go and bought a small bunch from the local market. Yesterday morning, I decided I'd have one for breakfast along with my usual corn flakes. After I wash it down with coffee, I immediately start feeling like crap, but one of my roommates had a stomach bug over the weekend, so I just automatically assume that I must have contracted said bug and rush off to my four hour class. Four hours of hell, that is. As soon as I sit down, my nose becomes a waterfall with off and on sneezing fits. Next, cue the most god awful indigestion and acid reflux I have ever experienced. I keep telling myself that I only have to make it to 1 o' clock, then I can just go to bed. Easier said than done, but I finally get home and find little success in napping. Once I get up, I discover that I have a nice little rash starting in each armpit, which I chalk up to having switched deodorants just that morning. Finish off a bottle of Maalox with some advil and commenced sleep attempt number two. I wake up a little more clear headed this time and begin to assess my situation. The rash is now worse and I start wondering, what if the deodorant didn't cause the rash? Is there a single thing that could possibly explain all of my symptoms? I started to ask myself out loud, ""Did I eat anything today that I don't usually..... oh, shit."" In an instant my fingers were flying on Google to search ""banana allergy"" only to find a multitude of symptom lists that pretty much specifically described my day of hell. By this time, my face had even started to swell a bit, but now knowing what I  was up against, I bought some benedryl, had a couple of beers and went back to sleep. Woke up this morning feeling much better, and unlike Pam Poovey, I will not continue to stuff my face with foods I know I am allergic to. No more bananas. Ever.

TL;DR:","Had a stomach bug and took Benadryl when eating a banana, it stopped my stomach from cramping up and got me all better."

TITLE: Me [16F] have been dating my bf [16M] for 2 years and have not done anything sexually yet, is this alright?

POST: Hi guy's I just need some advice to calm my nerves. 

So I have been dating this guy for 2 years since we were the age of 14. The most we have done is make out and cuddle, that's it nothing more. 

We are only 16 and I was wondering is it a bad thing we have not done anything sexually for the 2 years we have been dating? because you hear of people taking it slow, but are we going to slow?

I have not spoken to him about this, but I just need an outside opinion on this before I do. Because I don't want to mess this up, I really love this guy

TL;DR:","I love my bf, but want to wait until he is ready because I don't want to mess this up, and is this a bad thing to do?"

TITLE: My fellow redditors! Within reason.. turn your ridiculous ideas into porn!

POST: Soo there isn't a question in the headline.. How about.. Reddit, what kind of porn would you make if you could?

Be respectful. I may be a whore, but I'm a human being above all else!

I am in the process of developing a website for my alter ego porn star. 

I've decided that aside from all the normal boring porn stuff that I want really memorable pornos. Full length movies or short clips.

So far we are having a scenario where I am dared to suck off a corpse in a morgue.

I'm also going to fuck every super hero to which a costume is available and I am particularly excited about that!

Giant mud pit. Need I say more?

Sadly, unicorn porn was already made...

So, in this vast pool of insane and colorful minds that is reddit.. I ask you to share with me elaborate or not so elaborate ideas for porn. They don't all have to be silly, some things you legitimately might want to see and never do or never see enough of it.

In all seriousness your idea could get turned into the real thing and if it does I will send you a free copy of the production so you can show your friends!

TL;DR:","My alter ego's are coming up with so many awesome ideas, what would happen in the real world if a porn star was to take on an actual role in one of them."

TITLE: Me [18M] questioning if I should ask out my friend [17F]

POST: Ok so perhaps this isn't the most dramatic thing you have seen on this subreddit but I feel like I'm stuck.

I have been friends with this girl for a while now asking her and things were going great until I asked her to prom. I am hoping this will be a great night however ever since I asked her a couple weeks ago I find I can no longer talk to her. Out conversations are awkward with me trying to start the majority of topics (Badly written but you get the picture)

I really like the girl but i'm wondering if she saw too much into the prom-posal. Should I just give up, or ask her out? Im not sure

TL;DR:",What would you all do in this situation? Ask that girl out? Give up? Why or why not?
