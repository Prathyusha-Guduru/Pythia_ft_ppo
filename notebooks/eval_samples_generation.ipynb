I shopped around for a surgeon until I found one whose style was more of the natural look I was going for. At the date of my scheduling, I was required to put down 10% since I wasn‚Äôt financing the surgery through their preferred cosmetic lender, so I swiped my card for $500, scheduled my appointment, and was given information on how/when to pay the balance. Well, life was happening and schedules were busy (such is life with kids) and it must‚Äôve slipped my mind to call and pay the balance but it also slipped the mind of the billing specialist at the office because on the day of surgery, I still hadn‚Äôt paid the remaining balance. My ex-husband and I decided to just not mention it and see if they, did and at my 24hr and 2wk follow-up, the office still hadn‚Äôt requested the final payment. I checked my account regularly and monitored transactions yet after 6 months, they never charged me or reached out for payment, so we closed out that bank account to ensure we wouldn‚Äôt be hit with a future transaction.\n",

It has new show episodes the second it comes out and good quality videos. I haven't gotten any virus or hacks. I watch lots of Anime, but I don't know a lot about things going on online. I hadn't noticed that 9anime and other websites got deleted, so I've been using it as normal. It's hard getting an answer to some of my questions, so I hope you guys would be able to help! I even made a discord account to try talk to some communities that were centered around this, just to be turned down.
